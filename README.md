## Deployment
This project is deployed using GitHub Pages.

Ensure that the `homepage` field in `package.json` is set correctly:

```

## Design Decisions
- **React & Bootstrap**: Chosen for faster development and responsive design.
- **Component-Based Structure**: Ensures code reusability and maintainability.
- **CSS Modules**: Used to avoid global style conflicts.

## Challenges Faced
- **Handling Deployment Errors**: Encountered issues while setting up GitHub Pages, resolved by correctly configuring the `homepage` field.
- **Responsive Design Adjustments**: Fine-tuned breakpoints to ensure the design works across all devices.

## Trade-offs
- **Bootstrap vs. Tailwind CSS**: Bootstrap was chosen for its predefined components, even though Tailwind offers more customization.
- **React for a Simple Page**: Even though React is powerful, a static HTML/CSS page could have been a simpler alternative.
